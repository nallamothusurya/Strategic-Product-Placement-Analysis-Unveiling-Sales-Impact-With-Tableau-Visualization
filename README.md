Strategic Product Placement Analysis: Unveiling Sales Impact

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of strategic product placement on the sales of gourmet food items within a retail environment. By leveraging a synthesized sales dataset, this analysis aims to answer a critical business question: Which product placement strategies drive the most revenue and sales volume?

The core of this project is an interactive Tableau dashboard that translates complex sales data into clear, actionable insights for marketing, sales, and operations teams. The dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions on in-store marketing, shelf allocation, and promotional campaigns.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective

The primary goal is to provide a quantitative assessment of different product placement tactics, including:

End-Cap Displays: Placements at the end of aisles.

Eye-Level Shelving: Prime placement directly in the customer's line of sight.

Checkout Counters: Impulse-buy locations near the point of sale.

Promotional Bins: Special, temporary displays.

The analysis seeks to identify the most profitable strategies, understand their impact across different store locations and product categories, and ultimately provide recommendations to maximize return on investment (ROI) for in-store marketing efforts.



ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Business Recommendations

The analysis uncovered several actionable insights:

End-Cap Dominance: End-cap displays consistently generated ~35% more revenue than standard eye-level placements, confirming their value for high-traffic products.

Recommendation: Reserve end-cap displays for high-margin, best-selling products or new product launches to maximize visibility and sales.

Impulse-Buy Power: While checkout counter placements had lower overall sales volume, they showed the highest sales velocity for low-cost, high-margin items like chocolates and snacks.

Recommendation: Optimize the checkout counter assortment with impulse-buy items that have a high profit margin.

Regional Variation: Stores in urban centers saw a significantly higher uplift (+15%) from promotional bin placements compared to suburban locations.

Recommendation: Tailor promotional strategies based on store demographics and location. Deploy aggressive promotional bins in urban stores.

Open the Strategic_Product_Placement.twbx file with Tableau. The .twbx file is a packaged workbook and includes the data source.

Interacting with the Dashboard:

Filters: Use the filters on the right-hand side to narrow down the data by date, store, or product.

Tooltips: Hover over any data point (a bar, a map region, a point on a line chart) to see detailed information.

Cross-Filtering: Click on an element, such as the "End-Cap" bar in the performance chart, to filter the entire dashboard to show data for that selection only.

ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

A/B Testing Analysis: Integrate data from controlled A/B tests to add statistical significance to the findings.

Inventory & Stock-Out Correlation: Add inventory data to analyze how stock levels affect sales performance for each placement type.

Predictive Analytics: Develop a model to forecast sales uplift based on a proposed placement strategy for a new product.
